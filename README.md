**Lemon AI​** is the first **​full-stack, open-source, agentic AI framework**, offering a **​fully local alternative​** to platforms like **Manus & Genspark AI. It features an integrated Code Interpreter VM sandbox for safe execution**.​​

**​Lemon AI empowers deep research, web browsing, viable coding, and data analysis – running entirely on your local hardware.​​** It supports ​**planning, action, reflection, and memory​** functionalities using **​local LLMs**​ (like DeepSeek, Qwen, Llama, Gemma) via **Ollama**, ensuring **​complete privacy and zero cloud dependency.**

For enhanced security, Lemon AI operates within a ​**local Virtual Machine (VM) sandbox.** This sandbox **​protects your machine's files and operating system​** by safely handling all code writing, execution, and editing tasks.

Additionally, Lemon AI provides the **​flexibility to configure enhanced results**​ using APIs from leading cloud models like **​Claude, GPT, Gemini, and Grok.**
